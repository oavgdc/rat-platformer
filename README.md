# rat-platformer
2023-2024 OAVGDC's very historically accurate 2-D action platformer, where you play as Otto von Bismarck the rat and fight Napoleonâ€™s henchmen throughout each level, taking down his generals and gathering their powers to eventually reach and overthrow the crumbling Napoleon.

This is OAVGDC's first game!
